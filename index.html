            <p>This article is about the totality of entities. For other uses, see World (disambiguation) and Earth.

                The world is the totality of entities, 
                the whole of reality, or everything that is.
                 The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields.
                Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality of worlds".
                Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of parts.
                 In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as "[t]he totality of all space and time; 
                all that is, has been, and will be". Theories of modality talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how 
                things could have been. 
                Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery 
                of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the "horizon of all horizons". </p>

                <p>Nanotechnology (sometimes shortened to nanotech) is the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest widespread description of nanotechnology[27][28] referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold.</p>
